# Naptha Stack RFCs

This repository hosts Request for Comments (RFCs) for the Naptha Stack. RFCs are proposals for significant changes to the stack, enabling community discussion, documentation, and decision-making in a structured manner.

## What is an RFC?

An RFC is a design document that outlines a proposed change, the motivation behind it, and the impact it may have. RFCs allow the community to discuss proposals before implementation.

## When to Submit an RFC

Use the RFC process for changes that:
- Introduce major new features or architectural changes.
- Impact multiple components of the Naptha Stack.
- Require community consensus before implementation.
- Affect backwards compatibility or introduce breaking changes.

For minor fixes, bug reports, or small enhancements, regular GitHub issues or pull requests should be used instead.

## How to Submit an RFC

1. **Fork this repository** and create a new branch.
2. **Copy `TEMPLATE.md`** and rename it to a descriptive filename (e.g., `rfc-github-process.md`).
3. **Write your proposal**, ensuring it includes all required sections.
4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** to this repository.
5. Engage in discussion and refine the RFC as needed.
6. Once consensus is reached, the RFC will be assigned a number and merged.

## RFC Lifecycle

Each RFC progresses through these stages:

- **Draft** – Open for discussion and iteration.
- **Review** – Under active community and maintainer review.
- **Final** – Approved and merged into the repository.
- **Withdrawn** – Closed without acceptance or replaced by another RFC.
